CT AB/PEL WITH LIVER TRIPHASIC

1/3/2020 CT abdomen and pelvis with triphasic liver

CLINICAL STATEMENT: Metastatic rectal cancer. Bleeding from ostomy.
TECHNIQUE: Multislice helical sections were obtained from the domes of the
diaphragm to the pubic symphysis after oral and intravenous contrast
administration. Pre-contrast, late arterial-, and venous-phase images were
obtained.

RADIATION DOSE (DLP): 2885 mGy-cm

COMPARISON: December 19, 2019.

CORRELATION: None.

FINDINGS:

HEPATOBILIARY: Cirrhotic hepatic morphology . Segment
6 ablation zone with unchanged heterogeneous parenchymal enhancement
probably postradiation changes changes. Probably unchanged hepatic
lesions:

* Segment 2/4 a, 3.2 x 2.5 cm (series 4, image 43), previously 2.6 x 2.1
cm

* Segment 5 2.7 x 2.0 cm

Hepatic and portal veins remain patent. Mild enhancement of the
gallbladder wall, likely reactive.

SPLEEN: Unremarkable.

PANCREAS : No pancreatic ductal dilatation.
Unchanged fluid density lesion in the pancreatic body/tail junction
measuring 2.5 x 2.0 cm, probably pseudocyst.

ADRENAL GLANDS: Unremarkable.

KIDNEYS: Unremarkable.

ABDOMINOPELVIC NODES: Unchanged slightly prominent probably reactive
mesenteric lymph nodes.

PELVIC ORGANS: Unremarkable.
PERITONEUM/MESENTERY /
BOWEL: Unchanged abdominal wall

ileostomy. No definite arterial extravasation is identified, though the
inferior margin of the ostomy site is excluded from the field-of-view on
the arterial phase imaging. Assessment for intraluminal arterial
extravasation is precluded by positive oral contrast. Robbie unchanged
Perirectal recurrence corresponding to FDG avidity on the October 21, 2019
PET/CT measures approximately 1.9 x 1.2 cm (series 5, image 95). Unchanged
mild wall thickening involving multiple small bowel loops, probably
reactive.

Increased moderate volume ascites.
BONES/SOFT TISSUES: No suspicious osseous lesion.

OTHER: Increased small left-sided
pleural effusion. Unchanged nodule in the right lower lobe measuring 1.0
by 0.9 cm (series 2, image 5) . Since October 21, 2019, probably unchanged
left hilar lymph node measuring 1.3 x 1.3 cm. Central line tip at right
atrium

IMPRESSION:

1. Since December 19, 2019, study is not dedicated to evaluate for GI
bleed.

2. Increased moderate ascites with with unchanged edematous small bowel
loops is probably reactive.
