pathologically enlarged or hypermetabolic abdominal, pelvic, or
inguinal lymph nodes.

Musculoskeletal: There is a fracture in the right posterior sixth
rib, with associated hypermetabolic activity. Redemonstration of
orthopedic hardware in the left hip.

Impression

1. Diffusely increased FDG uptake and consolidative changes in the
right lung, consistent with post treatment changes.

2. New, mildly-FDG avid, 5 mm nodule in the right lung incompletely
evaluated on the non breath-hold CT. Recommend diagnostic chest CT
for further evaluation of nodule and to establish new baseline.

3. Small pneumothorax in the anterior right lung, as well as a right
pleural effusion.

4. Fracture of the posterior right sixth rib, likely treatment
related.

I have personally reviewed the images for this examination and agree
with the report transcribed above.
